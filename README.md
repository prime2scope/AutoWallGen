# AutoWallGen
Automatically generates walls for the layout of a map made with [Valve Hammer Editor](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor).

This program takes a [VMF file](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VMF) as ***Input*** (where the VMF has a floor layout made of [Brushes](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Brush))

The program will create a **new** VMF file as ***Output***, this file will contain the automatically Generated walls as well as the original layout. (the *new* walls will be in their own [Visgroup](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Visgroup) and can be hidden easily)

### VMF Requirements

The ***input*** layout must follow a few simple rules for the walls to be made correctly:
1. All the floors must be Snapped to the Grid, and share the same **thickness** of **16 units** on the Vertical Z axis.
2. Floors must be aligned "flush" with each other (no gap) for intersection walls to be removed.
  - If there is a gap between 2 floors, then there will be a wall there
3. All side faces of the floor MUST be Vertical,
